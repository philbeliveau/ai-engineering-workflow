      <step n="1">Ask user for project name if not already known</step>

        IF project does NOT exist:
          - Create folder structure: {output_folder}/{project_name}/
          - Create subfolders: phase-0-scoping/, phase-1-feature/, phase-2-training/, phase-3-inference/, phase-4-evaluation/, phase-5-operations/
          - Initialize sidecar.yaml with project_name, created date, empty stepsCompleted
          - Initialize project-spec.md and decision-log.md
          - Display: "Project '{project_name}' initialized!"
        IF project EXISTS:
          - Read sidecar.yaml to get current state
          - Display progress summary (stepsCompleted, architecture, last step)
          - Ask: Continue where left off? Review progress? Start fresh with new name?
          - Handle user choice accordingly
