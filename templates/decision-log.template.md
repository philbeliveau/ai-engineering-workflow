# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Decision Log

This document records all architectural decisions made during the project, including knowledge references from the Knowledge MCP.

---

## Decision Record Format

Each decision follows the ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier (e.g., ARCH-001, FP-001) |
| **Decision** | What was decided |
| **Context** | Why the decision was needed |
| **Options Considered** | Alternatives evaluated |
| **Rationale** | Why this option was chosen |
| **Knowledge Reference** | MCP query that informed the decision |
| **Consequences** | Trade-offs and implications |

### ID Prefixes

| Prefix | Phase | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `ARCH-` | 0 | Architecture decisions |
| `FP-` | 1 | Feature Pipeline decisions |
| `TP-` | 2 | Training Pipeline decisions |
| `IP-` | 3 | Inference Pipeline decisions |
| `EV-` | 4 | Evaluation decisions |
| `OP-` | 5 | Operations decisions |

## Decision Template

Use this template when adding new decisions:

```markdown
### [ID]: [Short Title]

**Decision:** [What was decided]

**Date:** [Date]
**Phase:** [Phase number and name]

**Context:**
[Why this decision was needed - the problem or question]

**Options Considered:**
1. [Option 1]: [Brief description]
2. [Option 2]: [Brief description]
3. [Option 3]: [Brief description]

**Choice:** [Selected option]

**Rationale:**
[Why this option was chosen over alternatives]

**Knowledge Reference:**
- Query: `[MCP endpoint]: [topic]`
- Key insights: [What the knowledge base said]

**Consequences:**
- [Positive consequence 1]
- [Positive consequence 2]
- [Trade-off or risk 1]
- [Trade-off or risk 2]

**Related Decisions:** [IDs of related decisions, if any]
```
