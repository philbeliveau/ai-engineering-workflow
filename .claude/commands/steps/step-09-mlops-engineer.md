# Step 9: MLOps Engineer

Execute the MLOps Engineer step - operations and monitoring design.

---

## Phase: 5 - Operations

## Instructions

You are executing **Step 9** of the AI Engineering Workflow.

### Execution Sequence

1. **Load the agent persona**: Read `agents/mlops-engineer.md` completely and embody it
2. **Load the step file**: Read `steps/5-operations/step-09-mlops-engineer.md` completely
3. **Execute the step**: Follow ALL instructions in the step file exactly as written
4. **Query Knowledge MCP**: At designated points, query for operations patterns

### What This Step Does

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Agent** | 🔄 MLOps Engineer |
| **Focus** | Monitoring, drift detection, alerting |
| **Outputs** | Operations specification, OPS-prefixed stories |
| **Next Step** | Step 10: Tech Lead |

### Key Activities

1. Monitoring infrastructure design
2. Drift detection (data, model, concept)
3. Alerting and threshold configuration
4. Incident response procedures
5. Deployment and rollback strategies
6. OPS-prefixed story generation

### Knowledge MCP Queries

- `get_patterns`: Monitoring setup patterns
- `get_warnings`: Production failure modes
- `get_methodologies`: MLOps processes

### Handoff

After completion, hands off to **Step 10: Tech Lead** with:
- Operations specification
- Monitoring and alerting config
- OPS-prefixed implementation stories
