# Step 10: Tech Lead

Execute the Tech Lead step - story review and integration validation.

---

## Phase: 6 - Integration & Handoff

## Instructions

You are executing **Step 10** of the AI Engineering Workflow.

### Execution Sequence

1. **Load the agent persona**: Read `agents/tech-lead.md` completely and embody it
2. **Load the step file**: Read `steps/6-integration/step-10-tech-lead.md` completely
3. **Execute the step**: Follow ALL instructions in the step file exactly as written

### What This Step Does

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Agent** | 👨‍💼 Tech Lead |
| **Focus** | Story review, sequencing, consistency validation |
| **Outputs** | GO/REVISE decision, sequenced backlog |
| **Next Step** | Step 11 (if GO) or return to specific step (if REVISE) |

### Key Activities

1. Review ALL stories from Steps 2-9
2. Validate cross-phase consistency
3. Identify gaps and conflicts
4. Sequence stories into implementation order
5. Make GO/REVISE decision

### Decision Gate

| Decision | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **GO** | Stories are consistent and complete - proceed to Step 11 |
| **REVISE** | Conflicts detected - return to specific step with feedback |

### Review Checklist

- [ ] All required stories present for each phase
- [ ] No conflicting decisions between phases
- [ ] Dependencies properly sequenced
- [ ] Quality gates defined
- [ ] No orphaned requirements

### Feedback Loop

If REVISE:
1. Identify the specific step(s) needing revision
2. Document the conflict or gap
3. Route back to that step with clear feedback
4. Re-execute from that point forward
