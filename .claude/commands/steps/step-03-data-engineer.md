# Step 3: Data Engineer

Execute the Data Engineer step - data pipeline design.

---

## Phase: 1 - Feature Pipeline

## Instructions

You are executing **Step 3** of the AI Engineering Workflow.

### Execution Sequence

1. **Load the agent persona**: Read `agents/data-engineer.md` completely and embody it
2. **Load the step file**: Read `steps/1-feature/step-03-data-engineer.md` completely
3. **Execute the step**: Follow ALL instructions in the step file exactly as written
4. **Query Knowledge MCP**: At designated points, query for data patterns and warnings

### What This Step Does

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Agent** | 🔧 Data Engineer |
| **Focus** | Data sources, ingestion, cleaning, quality |
| **Outputs** | Data pipeline specification, DATA-prefixed stories |
| **Next Step** | Step 4: Embeddings Engineer |

### Key Activities

1. Data source identification and cataloging
2. Ingestion pipeline design
3. Data cleaning and transformation logic
4. Quality checks and validation rules
5. Storage and versioning strategy
6. DATA-prefixed story generation

### Knowledge MCP Queries

- `get_patterns`: Data ingestion patterns
- `get_warnings`: Data quality pitfalls

### Handoff

After completion, hands off to **Step 4: Embeddings Engineer** with:
- Data pipeline specification
- Source catalog with formats and volumes
- DATA-prefixed implementation stories
