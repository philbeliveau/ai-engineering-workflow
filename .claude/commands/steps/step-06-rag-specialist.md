# Step 6: RAG Specialist

Execute the RAG Specialist step - retrieval pipeline design.

---

## Phase: 3 - Inference Pipeline

## Instructions

You are executing **Step 6** of the AI Engineering Workflow.

### Execution Sequence

1. **Load the agent persona**: Read `agents/rag-specialist.md` completely and embody it
2. **Load the step file**: Read `steps/3-inference/step-06-rag-specialist.md` completely
3. **Execute the step**: Follow ALL instructions in the step file exactly as written
4. **Query Knowledge MCP**: At designated points, query for RAG patterns

### What This Step Does

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Agent** | 🔍 RAG Specialist |
| **Focus** | RAG pipeline, retrieval, reranking, context |
| **Outputs** | RAG pipeline specification, RAG-prefixed stories |
| **Next Step** | Step 7: Prompt Engineer |

### Key Activities

1. Retrieval strategy selection (dense, sparse, hybrid)
2. Query processing and expansion
3. Reranking approach configuration
4. Context window optimization
5. Citation and source attribution
6. RAG-prefixed story generation

### Knowledge MCP Queries

- `get_patterns`: RAG architecture patterns
- `get_decisions`: Retrieval strategy trade-offs
- `get_warnings`: RAG anti-patterns

### Handoff

After completion, hands off to **Step 7: Prompt Engineer** with:
- RAG pipeline specification
- Retrieval and reranking configuration
- RAG-prefixed implementation stories
