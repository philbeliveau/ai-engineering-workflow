# AI Engineering Workflow

Start or continue an AI engineering project using the FTI (Feature-Training-Inference) pipeline pattern.

---

## Instructions

You are launching the **AI Engineering Workflow** - a structured approach to building production LLM systems with 11 specialized agents.

### Activation Steps

1. **Load the main workflow file**: Read `workflow.md` at the project root completely before proceeding
2. **Follow the initialization sequence** exactly as documented in the workflow
3. **Execute step by step** - never skip ahead or load multiple steps

### What This Workflow Does

Guides you through building AI/LLM applications using:
- **11 specialized agents** (Business Analyst, FTI Architect, Data Engineer, etc.)
- **Knowledge MCP integration** for grounded decisions
- **Story generation** at each phase for implementation handoff
- **FTI pipeline pattern** (Feature → Training → Inference)

### Quick Reference

| Phase | Steps | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Scoping** | 1-2 | Requirements + Architecture decision |
| **Feature** | 3-4 | Data pipeline + Embeddings |
| **Training** | 5 | Fine-tuning (conditional) |
| **Inference** | 6-7 | RAG + Prompts |
| **Evaluation** | 8 | Quality framework |
| **Operations** | 9 | Monitoring + Alerting |
| **Integration** | 10-11 | Review + Handoff |
